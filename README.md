# Self-driving-car
Built a 2 dimensonal self driving car using artificial intelligence and machine learing with the help of Pytorch and NumPy

Everything works correctly.
To run the program run map.py and ai.py after to see the 2D self driving car.
You can draw lines on the window which the object can learn to avoid everytime it detects it.
